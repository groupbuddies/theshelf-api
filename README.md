This is a fork of [The Shelf](https://github.com/groupbuddies/theshelf). In the fork we made The Shelf a Rails api, you can vistit [theshelf-angular](https://github.com/groupbuddies/theshelf-angular) for a client.

The Shelf is an online library for small companies to keep track of their books, encourage reading and to create discussion around knowledge. It has been developed as an internal tool by Group Buddies.
